# **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in Apache Spark**

---

## **1. What is a DAG?**

A **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** is a **graph of vertices and edges**, where:

* **Vertices** represent computation steps or RDDs.
* **Edges** represent the **dependency between operations**.
* **Directed** means the graph flows in one direction (from earlier to later steps).
* **Acyclic** means there are no cycles—once a path is followed, you never return to a previously visited node.

In **Apache Spark**, a DAG represents a **logical execution plan** built from user-defined transformations (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`, etc.) before any computation actually occurs.

---

## **2. Why DAG in Spark?**

Apache Spark does **lazy evaluation** of transformations. It doesn’t execute each transformation immediately—instead, it **builds a DAG** of all transformations. Execution begins **only when an action** (like `count()`, `collect()`, `saveAsTextFile()`) is called.

This approach offers:

* **Optimization** through stage pipelining
* **Fault tolerance** via lineage
* **Efficient scheduling** and execution

---

## **3. DAG Formation Process**

### Step-by-step DAG Creation

1. **User defines transformations**:

   ```python
   rdd1 = sc.textFile("data.txt")
   rdd2 = rdd1.filter(lambda x: "error" in x)
   rdd3 = rdd2.map(lambda x: (x, 1))
   ```

2. **Spark builds a DAG**:

   * Each transformation is logged into a **lineage graph**.
   * No actual computation is triggered yet.

3. **Action is called**:

   ```python
   result = rdd3.reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)
   result.collect()
   ```

4. **DAG Scheduler** submits the execution plan as a set of **stages**, which are broken into **tasks** that run on worker nodes.

## **4. Components of DAG in Spark**

| Component  | Description                                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vertex** | Represents an RDD and the computation applied to it             |
| **Edge**   | Represents dependency between RDDs (narrow or wide)             |
| **Stage**  | A set of transformations that can be computed without shuffling |
| **Task**   | A unit of work sent to an executor, one per partition per stage |

---

## **5. Narrow vs Wide Dependencies**

DAGs help Spark understand **data dependencies** and plan accordingly:

### 5.1 Narrow Dependency

* Each parent partition is used by **at most one** child partition.
* Example: `map`, `filter`
* Data can be pipelined without shuffle

### 5.2 Wide Dependency

* Multiple child partitions depend on **multiple parent partitions**.
* Example: `groupByKey`, `reduceByKey`
* Requires **shuffling** data across nodes

---

## **6. DAG Scheduler in Spark**

Spark has **two schedulers**:

1. **DAG Scheduler**:

   * Converts logical execution plan (DAG of stages) into **stages and tasks**.
   * Handles **task retries**, **failure recovery**, and **stage completion**.
   * Optimizes execution by **pipelining narrow transformations**.

2. **Task Scheduler**:

   * Takes tasks from the DAG Scheduler and schedules them on cluster nodes (executors).

---

## **7. DAG Execution Example**

### Code:

```python
rdd = sc.textFile("file.txt")
          .filter(lambda x: "error" in x)
          .map(lambda x: (x, 1))
          .reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)
          .saveAsTextFile("output")
```

### DAG View:

1. **Stage 1**:

   * `textFile` → `filter` → `map`
   * Narrow transformations

2. **Shuffle boundary** due to `reduceByKey` (wide dependency)

3. **Stage 2**:

   * Aggregation logic → `saveAsTextFile`

This DAG is **divided into stages**, and each stage has **multiple tasks**, which are executed in **parallel**.

## **8. DAG vs Execution Plan in MapReduce**

| Feature              | MapReduce                | Spark DAG                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Intermediate Results | Stored in HDFS           | Stored in memory (unless spilled)                |
| Execution            | Step by step, rigid      | Flexible, optimized via DAG                      |
| Fault Tolerance      | Re-runs entire job/stage | Recomputes only the lost partition using lineage |
| Performance          | Slower due to disk I/O   | Faster due to in-memory and pipelining           |
| Optimization         | Manual                   | Automatic stage optimization via DAG Scheduler   |

---

## **9. Benefits of DAG in Spark**

* **Pipelining**: Groups transformations together to minimize pass-throughs over the data.
* **Optimization**: Identifies stage boundaries and reduces shuffling when possible.
* **Fault Recovery**: Uses lineage to recompute only lost partitions.
* **Execution Efficiency**: Reduces execution time and resource usage.
* **Introspection**: DAG visualizations (e.g., in Spark UI) help in debugging and performance tuning.

## **10. Visualizing DAG in Spark UI**

After submitting a job, you can access:

* **Spark Web UI** at `http://<driver-node>:4040`
* Navigate to **Stages** → View **DAG Visualization**
* You will see stages, task counts, dependencies, shuffle stages, etc.

---

## **11. Summary**

* DAG in Spark is a **logical representation** of operations.
* It tracks how **transformations** are applied to build final results.
* It enables **lazy evaluation**, **stage pipelining**, and **fault tolerance**.
* It is central to Spark's execution and optimization model.
