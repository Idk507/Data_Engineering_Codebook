## ü§ñ Databricks Machine Learning Platform (Mosaic AI)

### 1. **Unified ML Workflow**

Databricks via **Mosaic AI** offers an end-to-end, unified ML/AI experience‚Äîfrom data prep to deployment‚Äîwithout needing separate tools ([Databricks Documentation][1], [Databricks Documentation][2]):

* **AI Playground** for interactive prompt engineering and LLM testing ([Databricks Documentation][2])
* **Agent Bricks**: No-code orchestration layer to build AI agents ([Databricks Documentation][2])
* **MLflow integration**: Full lifecycle tracking, model registry, and versioning for both classical ML and GenAI ([Databricks Documentation][3])

---

### 2. **Advanced Model Training**

* **Model Training & Fine-tuning**: Support for Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face, DeepSpeed ([Mosaic AI Training][4])
* **DBRX Foundation Model**: A state-of-the-art open-source LLM (132B parameters, 36B active) launched March 27, 2024; excels in reasoning, coding, math ([Wikipedia][5])
* **Mosaic AI Training stack**: Includes Composer, LLMFoundry, Megablocks‚Äîenabling large-scale LLM training ([Mosaic AI Training][6])

---

### 3. **Mosaic AI Core Components**

#### **a. Foundation Models & Model Serving**

* Access and deploy foundation models (e.g., Meta LLaMA, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT) via **Mosaic AI Model Serving**, offering REST APIs, auto-scaling, governed endpoints, and secure inference ([Databricks Documentation][7])
* Support for custom ML models‚Äîscikit, XGBoost, PyTorch, Hugging Face‚Äîwith real-time and batch inferencing ([Databricks Documentation][7])

#### **b. Mosaic AI Gateway**

* Central governance layer controlling model access, rate limits, logging, credentials, and usage‚Äîall tracked via Delta tables in Unity Catalog ([Databricks Documentation][8])

#### **c. Vector Search (Embedding Database)**

* Create and query vector indexes directly from Delta tables (sync on update), using HNSW, hybrid search, and secure access ([Microsoft Learn][9])

#### **d. Mosaic AI Agent Framework**

* Build **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** agents and multi-agent chains using Python or open-source frameworks, fully integrated with MLflow for tracing and agent lifecycle ([Databricks Documentation][3])

#### **e. Agent Evaluation**

* Automatically assess agent performance via LLM-powered ‚ÄúAI judges,‚Äù plus custom rule-based and human feedback workflows‚Äîgraphical UI enabled‚Äîfor iteration and quality control ([Databricks][10])

#### **f. Monitoring & Governance**

* **Lakehouse Monitoring**: Track data, feature, and model drift including GenAI agent stats ([Databricks Documentation][1])
* **Unity Catalog Governance**: Single pane of control across data, models, and AI assets‚Äîincluding functions and connections ([Databricks Documentation][3])

## üöÄ How to Start Exploring

1. Play in the **AI Playground**‚Äîtry prompts, compare LLMs, observe the behavior of DBRX and other models.
2. Build a **RAG Notebook**: ingest docs, embed them, index via Vector Search.
3. Wrap it in an agent through the **Agent Framework**, deploy it via **Model Serving**.
4. Use **Agent Evaluation** to tune quality, capture feedback, then redeploy.
5. Monitor everything‚Äîusage, costs, drift‚Äîthrough Lakehouse Monitoring integrated with MLflow.
