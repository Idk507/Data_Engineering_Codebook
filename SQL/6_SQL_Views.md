## **Sample Database Context**
We’ll use the following tables in the `ECommerceDB` database to illustrate SQL Views:

- **Customers**:
  ```sql
  CustomerID | Name        | Email               | City     | JoinDate
  -----------|-------------|---------------------|----------|------------
  101        | John Doe    | john@example.com    | New York | 2025-01-15
  102        | Jane Smith  | jane@example.com    | London   | 2025-03-22
  103        | Alice Brown | alice@example.com   | Paris    | 2025-07-01
  104        | Bob Wilson  | bob@example.com     | London   | 2025-06-15
  ```

- **Orders**:
  ```sql
  OrderID | CustomerID | OrderDate  | TotalAmount | DeliveryDate
  --------|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------
  1       | 101       | 2025-07-01 | 100.50      | 2025-07-05
  2       | 102       | 2025-07-02 | 250.75      | 2025-07-06
  3       | 101       | 2025-07-03 | 75.00       | NULL
  ```

## **SQL Views**

### **1. Concept of SQL Views**
- **Definition**: A **view** is a virtual table based on the result of a `SELECT` query. It doesn’t store data physically but provides a simplified or customized view of data from one or more tables. Views are stored as named queries in the database and can be queried like regular tables.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Virtual**: Views don’t store data; they dynamically retrieve data from underlying tables when queried.
  - **Reusable**: Simplifies complex queries by encapsulating them into a single object.
  - **Security**: Restricts access to specific columns or rows, enhancing data privacy.
  - **Updatable**: Some views (simple ones) can be updated, affecting the underlying tables (DBMS-dependent).
- **Use Case in Data Engineering**:
  - Simplifying complex ETL queries (e.g., pre-aggregated data for reporting).
  - Providing controlled access to data for analysts or applications.
  - Abstracting complex joins or calculations for downstream processes.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW view_name AS
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```

### **2. Types of Views**
- **Simple Views**: Based on a single table, often updatable.
- **Complex Views**: Involve multiple tables, joins, aggregations, or subqueries; usually not updatable.
- **Materialized Views**: Physically store data for performance (supported by some DBMSs like PostgreSQL, Oracle; not standard in MySQL).

### **3. Key Features and Benefits**
- **Simplification**: Encapsulates complex logic (e.g., joins, aggregations) into a single queryable object.
- **Security**: Limits access to sensitive columns (e.g., hiding `Email` from users).
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent query logic across applications.
- **Performance**: Materialized views can improve performance for frequent queries (DBMS-specific).
- **Maintenance**: Updates to underlying tables are automatically reflected in views.

### **4. Practical Examples of SQL Views**

#### **A. Creating a Simple View**
- **Scenario**: Create a view to show customer names and cities without sensitive data (e.g., `Email`).
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW CustomerSummary AS
  SELECT CustomerID, Name, City
  FROM Customers;
  ```
- **Query the View**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM CustomerSummary;
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```
  CustomerID | Name        | City
  -----------|-------------|--------
  101        | John Doe    | New York
  102        | Jane Smith  | London
  103        | Alice Brown | Paris
  104        | Bob Wilson  | London
  ```
- **Explanation**: The view provides a simplified interface to the `Customers` table, excluding `Email` and `JoinDate`.

#### **B. Creating a Complex View with Joins**
- **Scenario**: Create a view to show customers and their order details, including those without orders.
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW CustomerOrders AS
  SELECT c.CustomerID, c.Name, c.City, o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, o.TotalAmount
  FROM Customers c
  LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;
  ```
- **Query the View**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM CustomerOrders
  WHERE City = 'London';
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```
  CustomerID | Name       | City   | OrderID | OrderDate  | TotalAmount
  -----------|------------|--------|---------|------------|------------
  102        | Jane Smith | London | 2       | 2025-07-02 | 250.75
  104        | Bob Wilson | London | NULL    | NULL       | NULL
  ```
- **Explanation**: The view uses a `LEFT JOIN` to include all customers, showing `NULL` for those without orders (e.g., Bob Wilson).

#### **C. Creating a View with Aggregations**
- **Scenario**: Create a view to summarize the number of orders and total amount per customer.
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW CustomerOrderSummary AS
  SELECT c.CustomerID, c.Name, COUNT(o.OrderID) AS OrderCount, SUM(o.TotalAmount) AS TotalSpent
  FROM Customers c
  LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
  GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.Name;
  ```
- **Query the View**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM CustomerOrderSummary
  WHERE OrderCount > 0;
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```
  CustomerID | Name       | OrderCount | TotalSpent
  -----------|------------|------------|------------
  101        | John Doe   | 2          | 175.50
  102        | Jane Smith | 1          | 250.75
  ```
- **Explanation**: The view aggregates data, counting orders and summing amounts per customer, using `LEFT JOIN` to include all customers.

#### **D. Updating a Simple View**
- **Scenario**: Update a customer’s city through the `CustomerSummary` view (if the view is updatable, e.g., simple view without joins or aggregations).
  ```sql
  UPDATE CustomerSummary
  SET City = 'Berlin'
  WHERE CustomerID = 101;
  ```
- **Result**: Updates the `City` in the underlying `Customers` table to 'Berlin' for `CustomerID = 101`.
- **Note**: Complex views (e.g., with joins or aggregations) are typically not updatable. Check DBMS documentation for rules.

#### **E. Creating a Materialized View (PostgreSQL)**
- **Scenario**: Create a materialized view for performance (PostgreSQL-specific).
  ```sql
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW CustomerOrderSummaryMat AS
  SELECT c.CustomerID, c.Name, COUNT(o.OrderID) AS OrderCount
  FROM Customers c
  LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
  GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.Name;
  ```
- **Refresh the View**:
  ```sql
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CustomerOrderSummaryMat;
  ```
- **Explanation**: Unlike regular views, materialized views store data physically, improving query performance but requiring manual refreshes to update.

#### **F. Dropping a View**
- **Syntax**: `DROP VIEW view_name;`
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  DROP VIEW CustomerSummary;
  ```
- **Result**: Deletes the `CustomerSummary` view without affecting underlying tables.

### **5. Artifact with SQL Views Examples**

```sql

-- 1. Simple View: Customer Summary
CREATE VIEW CustomerSummary AS
SELECT CustomerID, Name, City
FROM Customers;

-- Query the View
SELECT * FROM CustomerSummary;

-- 2. Complex View with Joins: Customer Orders
CREATE VIEW CustomerOrders AS
SELECT c.CustomerID, c.Name, c.City, o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, o.TotalAmount
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;

-- Query the View
SELECT * FROM CustomerOrders
WHERE City = 'London';

-- 3. View with Aggregations: Customer Order Summary
CREATE VIEW CustomerOrderSummary AS
SELECT c.CustomerID, c.Name, COUNT(o.OrderID) AS OrderCount, SUM(o.TotalAmount) AS TotalSpent
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.Name;

-- Query the View
SELECT * FROM CustomerOrderSummary
WHERE OrderCount > 0;

-- 4. Updating a Simple View
UPDATE CustomerSummary
SET City = 'Berlin'
WHERE CustomerID = 101;

-- 5. Materialized View (PostgreSQL)
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW CustomerOrderSummaryMat AS
SELECT c.CustomerID, c.Name, COUNT(o.OrderID) AS OrderCount
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.Name;

-- Refresh Materialized View
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CustomerOrderSummaryMat;

-- 6. Dropping a View
DROP VIEW CustomerSummary;

```

## **Key Notes for Data Engineering**
- **Simplifying ETL Pipelines**: Views encapsulate complex joins or aggregations, making it easier to integrate with ETL tools like Apache Airflow or dbt.
- **Security**: Use views to restrict access to sensitive columns (e.g., hide `Email`) for analysts or applications.
- **Performance**:
  - Regular views don’t store data, so they rely on the performance of underlying queries. Optimize with indexes on joined or filtered columns.
  - Materialized views (where supported) improve performance for frequently accessed data but require refresh strategies.
- **Maintenance**: Views automatically reflect changes in underlying tables, reducing maintenance for query logic.
- **Limitations**:
  - Complex views may not be updatable.
  - Materialized views are not supported in all DBMSs (e.g., MySQL lacks native support).
- **DBMS Variations**:
  - MySQL: Supports basic views; no materialized views.
  - PostgreSQL: Supports both regular and materialized views.
  - SQL Server: Supports indexed views (similar to materialized views).
  - Oracle: Supports materialized views with advanced refresh options.
